# EJAX

I wanted to make a really simple and lightweight library to handle simple ajax requests using vanilla javascript. The ideas is that downloading the entire JQuery library when you don't really need it is unneccesary. This library makes it very easy to send out ajax requests in the browser without all of that.

### Progress

Right now, the library is incomplete. I have just started writing it. I'm looking to finish the simplest form of this library fairly quickly, so check back for updates.

### How to Use

coming soon
